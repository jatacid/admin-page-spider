Add sitemap navigation menus to your admin bar to jump to any page and edit from anywhere in Wordpress.

== Description ==

Navigating through pages in wordpress can be a major pain. If you're in a backend page and you want to get to a contact page it can take several clicks.

Now with Admin Page Spider you can crawl all over your pages from any point and you can access the Edit pages directly. From anywhere.

== Installation ==


You can either install it automatically from the WordPress admin, or do it manually:

Unzip the archive and put the admin-page-spider folder into your plugins folder (/wp-content/plugins/).
Activate the plugin from the Plugins menu.

**Usage**

In your dashboard go to the Settings -> Admin Page Spider.  Set the desired menus to 'Display' and hit save. Now they will display in your admin bar and allow you to jump around between your pages easily.

**Install Beaver Builder For Additional Features**
If you use Beaver Builder there's a similar menu available to instantly jump into the editing interface for Beaver Builder pages.

If you don't know what beaver builder is - check it out <a href="https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/?fla=215" target="_blank" id="yui_3_5_1_1_1461852476558_2773">here</a>.
