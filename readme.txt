View & Edit any page on your entire website from any location!

== Description ==

Navigating through pages in wordpress can be a major pain. If you're in a backend page and you want to get to a contact page it can take several clicks. First you have to visit the home page, then you have to visit the contact page, then you have to click the edit button - make your edits and then hit save and then visit the contact page again.

Now with Admin Page Spider you can crawl all over your pages from any point and you can access the Edit pages directly. From anywhere.

So now you can simply hover over your Admin Page Spider menu to the 'contact' page, choose to instantly open up the edit interface or simply view it - and you're done.  In one click!  No need to jump back and forth between the front and backend of Wordpress!

See the [screenshots tab](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/admin-page-spider/screenshots/) for more details.

**You can save up to 20-30% of your editing time!**
- Tested on a membership site with multiple, hidden pages, beaver builder and CSS hero -
